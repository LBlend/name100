# Name 100 something

Inspired by the "[name 100 women challenge](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/name-100-women-challenge)", this project is the same concept but limited to norwegian people, no matter the gender.

Although this repo is specifically made for naming famous norwegian people, it should be fairly easy to fork and adapt to making any other kind of naming challenge.

## Get started

Run:

```
npm run dev
```

to start a development server. See NextJS' documentation for more details.

## Forking

TBD
